Staycatin is a digital platform designed to help individuals and families plan memorable staycations—vacations at home or within their local city—by providing curated experiences, affordable packages, and personalized recommendations. 
The project focuses on promoting local tourism, cost-effective travel, and sustainable leisure while supporting small businesses such as local hotels, restaurants, and activity providers.
Through an easy-to-use mobile app and website, Staycatin enables users to:
Discover nearby attractions, hidden gems, and cultural experiences.
Book customized packages including local dining, spa services, workshops, and short trips.
Access exclusive discounts and rewards for supporting local businesses.
Plan themed staycations (romantic, adventure, family, wellness, etc.) tailored to individual preferences.
The goal of Staycatin is to redefine vacations by making them more affordable, accessible, and eco-friendly, while also boosting the local economy.
